# Mujoco build for Bazel:
Isolated Bazel build for Mujoco. 

This repository is based on [Mujoco for Swift](https://github.com/liuliu/swift-mujoco/tree/main) but just for the C API.

Currently a WIP. The Goal is to allow other Bazel builds to use this repositry as a `git_repository` rule in a `WORKSPACE` file.
